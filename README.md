# Personal Website
My [personal website](https://www.robertcooper.me/) used to showcase my portfolio of projects, blog posts, and some other random things. The site is hosted on Netlify and is easily updated with Netlify's continuous deployment.

## Local Development
To develop the application locally, first clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:robertcoopercode/personal-website.git
```

Next, install the project dependencies using `yarn`.

Now you can run `yarn dev` to automatically watch and compile assets, start a local Express server at `localhost:8080`, and start a Lambda functions server at `localhost:9000`. The Express server is setup to proxy Lambda function requests to `localhost:9000`.

## Deploy to Production
Deploying to production is as easy as pushing you local changes to Github's `master` branch for the repository ðŸ™Œ.
