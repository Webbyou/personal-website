        | Hi, I'm Robert Cooper 👋.
      p.about__description
        | I'm a front end developer currently working at 
        a(href='https://www.landr.com/en', target='_blank') LANDR
        |  in Montreal, Canada. I got into web development after figuring out that mechanical engineering wasn't for me. I'm a fan of beautiful user interfaces 🖼, eating meat 🥩, keeping track of data (e.g. sleep hours, financial budgets, hours spent in apps, etc.) 📊, and writting developer related articles 📝. Also, I am a person that can't stop buying Apple products even if it's a bad financial decision 🍎.
